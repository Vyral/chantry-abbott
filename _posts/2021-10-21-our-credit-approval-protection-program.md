We’re constantly being asked, “How can a buyer win an offer in this competitive real estate market?” It’s especially hard when you’re competing with cash offers. Today we’re going to share how we accomplish this.

I feel like the mortgage industry is broken. You get pre-approved with a loan officer, then you go under contract, then that lending company works with the underwriting team to finally get your loan approved.&nbsp;

We’ve all heard horror stories of delays, declined files, and changed programs. **This usually happens as a result of the company not uncovering everything in your file at the beginning of the process.** A flimsy pre-qualification or pre-approval is not good. It takes 30 days for them to find out there's a problem after you’re under contract.

One thing we like to do differently is our Credit Approval Protection Program. **With this program, we fully underwrite your file before you even start your home search.** The mortgage will still take 30 days to fund, but we carve out the first two weeks to put in the extra effort to know that your approval is 100% good.&nbsp;

Our Credit Approval Protection Program helps you make a strong offer to the seller with a quick closing deadline. You can remove financing contingencies and have the peace of mind that the leg work on your loan is basically done.

It’s a really neat solution, and our buyers are winning against cash offers with it. If you have any questions about the program or anything else related to mortgages, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
